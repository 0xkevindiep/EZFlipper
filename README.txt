Kash Machine is a program that finds brand new items on a third party 
marketplace, Grailed, and compares the buying price to the average sale price 
within the last week on another reselling marketplace, StockX, to calculate 
the possible profit margins from flipping that item. The user gets to choose 
the minimum profit threshold by adjusting the variable 'min_profit' to 
determine which items are worth reselling.
