# Kash Machine 

## Description
Kash Machine is a program that scrapes a third party marketplace, Grailed, to 
find brand new items and compares the buying price to the average sale price 
of that same item on another reselling marketplace, StockX, to calculate the 
possible profit margins from flipping that item. The user gets to choose the 
minimum profit threshold by adjusting the variable 'min_profit' to determine 
which items are worth reselling. With millions of listings on Grailed, there's 
an abundance of hidden profitable items ready to be found and flipped.
